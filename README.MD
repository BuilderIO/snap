The web framework for lightening fast web sites and apps. 

Compiles to fast, low level JS via [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid). Write components as Solid, or [JSX Lite](https://github.com/BuilderIO/jsx-lite)

## Goals

- Server side rendering with hydration
- File based routing
- Easy data fetching and transfer
- Prefetching
- Bleeding edge performance
- Easy to get started building with [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) or [JSX Lite](https://github.com/BuilderIO/jsx-lite) with prescriptive best practices
- Robust plugin system
- Options to render server side, statically, or a hybrid (e.g. with [stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/) at the edge)

## Getting started
